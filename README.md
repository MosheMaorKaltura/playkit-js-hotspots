# Playkit hotspots plugin


## Player V2 support
Although this plugin was developed to support playkit (player v7) it contains also an adapter to work with player v2. 

## Test player v2
1. copy file `src/player-v2/test.template.ejs` to `src/player-v2/test.ejs`
2. optional, update the entry id, partner id and ks. You can keep the existing values to see an entry with hotspots defined.
3. run `npm run start-v2`
